      <p>Music: I love to play piano and listen to all sorts of music, including rock, classical, and pop.</p>
      <p>Cooking: I love to experiment with recipes and serve it to my friends and family, and occasionally cats. I take particular pride in replicating restaurant dishes at home, although it comes at the cost of my waistline and many bars of butter.</p>
      <p>Fostering: I've fostered over 20 cats and kittens, and I'm currently fostering a cat named Monmonmon. (My friend's cat with the same fur pattern is named Monmon, so this little one is named after her.)</p>
